Yesterday, Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman told the Financial Times that ["most, if not all" white-collar tasks will be fully automated within 12 to 18 months](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-white-collar-tasks-automation-prediction-2026-2). Lawyers. Accountants. Project managers. Marketers. The people who sit in front of computers for a living. His words, not mine.

Hours later, Capgemini announced [€700 million in restructuring costs](https://www.investing.com/news/earnings/capgemini-to-spend-700-mln-on-restructuring-as-it-ramps-up-ai-transformation-4504356) to pivot its workforce toward AI-driven services. That is not a pilot program. That is not an innovation lab. That is nearly three quarters of a billion euros spent rearranging who does the work and how.

Meanwhile, the University of California system reported that [computer science enrollment is declining for the first time since the dot-com bust](https://www.govtech.com/education/higher-ed/cs-majors-decline-at-uc-for-first-time-since-early-2000s). Students are looking at entry-level software jobs being automated away and asking a very reasonable question: if AI writes the code, what exactly am I training for?

And in higher education itself, the New York Times published an op-ed titled ["A.I. Companies Are Eating Higher Education"](https://dnyuz.com/2026/02/13/a-i-companies-are-eating-higher-education/), describing how Anthropic charges steep enterprise fees to universities while simultaneously paying campus ambassadors to push its tools into classrooms. The companies building the disruption are also selling the response to it. That should make everyone uncomfortable.

These are not unrelated stories. They are the same story, told from different angles.

THE GRIND, the repetitive cognitive labor that has defined white-collar work for decades, is collapsing. Not slowly. Not theoretically. Now. The data pulls, the first drafts, the formatting, the research synthesis, the screening, the scheduling. All of it accelerating toward automation faster than most institutions are prepared to handle.

SHRM reported this week that [AI-driven productivity gains are fueling serious momentum toward the four-day workweek](https://www.shrm.org/mena/topics-tools/news/february-2026-labor-market-review-job-gains-exceed). That sounds optimistic until you ask the harder question: productivity gains for whom? If the gains come from eliminating tasks that humans used to do, then the question is not whether we get Fridays off. The question is whether we get to keep showing up at all.

Here is what I believe, and what I wrote *After the Grind* to argue: the end of THE GRIND is not the end of human value. It is the beginning of a different kind of value. Interpretation. Integration. Interpersonal connection. Imagination. The capacities that were always underneath the tasks, buried by the sheer volume of execution-level work.

But those capacities do not develop by accident. They require intention, practice, and institutions willing to redesign themselves around what humans do best rather than what machines cannot yet do.

Suleyman's 18-month timeline might be aggressive. Capgemini's €700 million bet suggests it might not be aggressive enough. Either way, the window for preparation is closing.

The professionals who thrive will not be the ones who grind harder. They will be the ones who stopped grinding and started thinking about what they are actually for.
