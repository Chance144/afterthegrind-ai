**Andrew Perkins** is Chair of the Department of Marketing and International Business at Washington State University's Carson College of Business.

His research spans consumer psychology, implicit cognition, and the forces that shape human judgment beneath conscious awareness. Over 25 years of published work, he has studied how surface signals shape perception (from wine labels to celebrity voice-overs), how implicit attitudes shift without our permission, how bodies become sites of social judgment, and how power, nostalgia, and awe shape the choices we make. His most recent work examines when moral outrage leads to public condemnation, and how identity and group membership shape that response.

The throughline across all of it: humans are not the rational agents our models assume. We are creatures of context, association, feeling, and habit. That's not a flaw. In an age of AI, it's the feature.

### The Book

*After the Grind: Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics* grew directly out of this research. It argues that AI has collapsed the repetitive cognitive labor that defined most professional careers, and that human value now lives in four domains: interpretation, integration, interpersonal connection, and imagination. The book is written for business students, early-career professionals, and educators rethinking what it means to prepare people for work.
