## Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics

AI can now do the tasks that used to define professional competence. So what's left for humans? Everything that matters.

*After the Grind* is a book about the future of professional work. It argues that the repetitive cognitive labor that filled most business careers (the searching, formatting, analyzing, reporting) was never the real value. It was the training ground. AI has collapsed that training ground, and what remains is the work that machines cannot do: interpretation, integration, human connection, and imagination.

### The 4I Framework

The book introduces the 4I framework, a map of the terrain where human value lives in the post-AI economy:

- **Interpretive**: Turning information into understanding. Reading context, subtext, and what the data isn't saying.
- **Integrative**: Connecting parts into functioning wholes. Seeing across systems, bridging disciplines, orchestrating complexity.
- **Interpersonal**: Building trust, leading through uncertainty, reading rooms instead of dashboards.
- **Imaginative**: Generating possibilities, anticipating futures, asking what we should build before we build it.

These are not skills to acquire in a weekend workshop. They are capacities developed over a career of paying attention.

### Who This Book Is For

*After the Grind* is written for business students entering a labor market that looks nothing like the one their professors trained for. It is for early-career professionals wondering whether their skills still matter. And it is for educators rethinking how to prepare students for work that AI has fundamentally changed.

If you've been asking "which jobs are safe from AI?" this book will show you why that's the wrong question, and what to ask instead.
