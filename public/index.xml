The question isn&amp;rsquo;t whether AI will change everything. It&amp;rsquo;s whether we&amp;rsquo;ll prepare for what comes after.</description></item><item><title>The AI-Washing Problem: When Companies Blame the Robot</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-17-the-ai-washing-problem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 06:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-17-the-ai-washing-problem/</guid><description>Tech layoffs keep climbing and CEOs keep pointing at AI. But a growing body of evidence suggests the robot is taking the blame for decisions that have nothing to do with automation.</description></item><item><title>The Solow Paradox Returns: AI Is Everywhere Except Where It Counts</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-16-the-solow-paradox-returns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-16-the-solow-paradox-returns/</guid><description>AI dominates headlines but barely registers in economic data. Meanwhile, millions of workers lack the adaptive capacity to navigate what&amp;rsquo;s coming. The gap between the noise and the reality tells us something important about human value.</description></item><item><title>Agents and the Work-to-Signal Ratio</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-agents-and-the-work-to-signal-ratio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-agents-and-the-work-to-signal-ratio/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="agents-and-the-work-to-signal-ratio">Agents and the Work-to-Signal Ratio&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Think about the last time you researched something for work. Not the moment you understood it. The hours before that moment. The Googling. The opening of fourteen tabs. The copying of relevant paragraphs into a document. The reformatting. The rewriting so it sounded like you and not like a Wikipedia article. The making of a chart because someone on the team &amp;ldquo;needs to see the visual.&amp;rdquo; The uploading, the linking, the publishing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eighteen Months to What, Exactly?</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-eighteen-months-to-what-exactly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-eighteen-months-to-what-exactly/</guid><description>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s AI chief says white-collar work will be automated in 18 months. Economists see jobless growth. Workers are already pivoting. The real question isn&amp;rsquo;t whether the grind disappears. It&amp;rsquo;s what replaces it.</description></item><item><title>How Agents Break the Procrastination Loop</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-how-agents-break-the-procrastination-loop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-how-agents-break-the-procrastination-loop/</guid><description>Procrastination isn&amp;rsquo;t laziness. It&amp;rsquo;s task aversion, driven by the friction between knowing what you want and actually starting. Agentic AI collapses that friction, and what&amp;rsquo;s left is the work you actually want to do.</description></item><item><title>The Invisible Admissions Office</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-the-invisible-admissions-office/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-the-invisible-admissions-office/</guid><description>Students are asking ChatGPT where to go to college.

What replaces them? Judgment, taste, and the ability to sit with ambiguity.</description></item><item><title>The Grind Is Ending Faster Than You Think</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-13-the-grind-is-ending-faster-than-you-think/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-13-the-grind-is-ending-faster-than-you-think/</guid><description>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s AI chief says 18 months.

&lt;p>His research spans consumer psychology, implicit cognition, and the forces that shape human judgment beneath conscious awareness. Over 25 years of published work, he has studied how surface signals shape perception (from wine labels to celebrity voice-overs), how implicit attitudes shift without our permission, how bodies become sites of social judgment, and how power, nostalgia, and awe shape the choices we make. His most recent work examines when moral outrage leads to public condemnation, and how identity and group membership shape that response.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>After the Grind</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/book/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="rethinking-your-business-career-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence-and-robotics">Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>AI can now do the tasks that used to define professional competence. So what&amp;rsquo;s left for humans? Everything that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>After the Grind&lt;/em> is a book about the future of professional work. It argues that the repetitive cognitive labor that filled most business careers (the searching, formatting, analyzing, reporting) was never the real value. It was the training ground. AI has collapsed that training ground, and what remains is the work that machines cannot do: interpretation, integration, human connection, and imagination.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Subscribe</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/subscribe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/subscribe/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="get-after-the-grind-essays-in-your-inbox">Get &lt;em>After the Grind&lt;/em> essays in your inbox&lt;/h2>
