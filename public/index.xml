&lt;p>Think about the last time you researched something for work. Not the moment you understood it. The hours before that moment. The Googling. The opening of fourteen tabs. The copying of relevant paragraphs into a document. The reformatting. The rewriting so it sounded like you and not like a Wikipedia article. The making of a chart because someone on the team &amp;ldquo;needs to see the visual.&amp;rdquo; The uploading, the linking, the publishing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Resume Is Dead</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-the-resume-is-dead/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/posts/2026-02-14-the-resume-is-dead/</guid><description>When AI can do the credentialed work, credentials stop being the signal. What replaces them? Judgment, taste, and the ability to sit with ambiguity.</description></item><item><title>You're Not Being Replaced.

&lt;p>His research spans consumer psychology, implicit cognition, and the forces that shape human judgment beneath conscious awareness. Over 25 years of published work, he has studied how surface signals shape perception (from wine labels to celebrity voice-overs), how implicit attitudes shift without our permission, how bodies become sites of social judgment, and how power, nostalgia, and awe shape the choices we make. His most recent work examines when moral outrage leads to public condemnation, and how identity and group membership shape that response.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>After the Grind</title><link>https://afterthegrind.ai/book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afterthegrind.ai/book/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="rethinking-your-business-career-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence-and-robotics">Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>AI can now do the tasks that used to define professional competence. So what&amp;rsquo;s left for humans? Everything that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>After the Grind&lt;/em> is a book about the future of professional work. It argues that the repetitive cognitive labor that filled most business careers (the searching, formatting, analyzing, reporting) was never the real value. It was the training ground. AI has collapsed that training ground, and what remains is the work that machines cannot do: interpretation, integration, human connection, and imagination.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
