<span>Andrew Perkins</span></div></header><section><p>This was quite a week.</p><p>On Thursday, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman told the <a href=https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/when-will-ai-kill-white-collar-office-jobs-18-months-microsoft-mustafa-suleyman/>Financial Times</a> that he expects &ldquo;most, if not all&rdquo; white-collar tasks to be automated within 12 to 18 months. Accounting, legal work, marketing, project management. Anything that involves sitting at a computer and processing information. His timeline is aggressive, but the direction is not controversial anymore. The grind is ending. The only debate is how fast.</p><p>Meanwhile, a <a href=https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/jobless-expansion-economy-gdp-growth-payroll-gains-unemployment-rate-ai-productivity/>Fortune analysis</a> flagged something economists have been whispering about for months: the economy is growing without creating new jobs. GDP is up. Payrolls are flat. AI-enabled automation is a &ldquo;plausible contributor,&rdquo; which is economist-speak for &ldquo;we can see it happening but our models haven&rsquo;t caught up yet.&rdquo; We are watching the early stages of a structural shift, and the data is starting to confirm what many workers already feel in their bones.</p><p>The human stories are already arriving. The <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/11/big-ai-job-swap-white-collar-workers-ditching-their-careers>Guardian reported</a> this week on white-collar workers voluntarily leaving their careers, not because they were fired, but because they can see the writing on the wall. One woman described losing her university IT helpdesk job when it was replaced by an AI kiosk. She&rsquo;s now retraining in a hands-on trade. Others are making similar pivots, moving toward work that requires physical presence, human judgment, or interpersonal connection. They are, whether they know it or not, moving toward what I call the 4I skills.</p><p>And they&rsquo;re right to do it. Former Google ethicist Tristan Harris <a href=https://fortune.com/2026/02/10/ai-taking-jobs-report-tristan-harris-google-ethicist-agi-technology/>warned this week</a> that unchecked AI adoption could trigger a global jobs market collapse by 2027. His argument goes beyond economics into political philosophy: if human labor becomes economically irrelevant, human political power follows. &ldquo;Does the state need humans anymore?&rdquo; he asked. It is a provocative question, and one that deserves a better answer than most policymakers are currently offering.</p><h2 id=the-university-response>The University Response</h2><p>Higher education is scrambling to respond. The <a href=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/university-of-phoenix-establishes-academic-ai-pillars-to-embed-ai-skills-across-online-degree-programs-302687965.html>University of Phoenix announced</a> a new framework to embed AI skills across all online degree programs, built on the recognition that 86% of employers expect AI to be transformative to their businesses by 2030. At <a href=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/university-education-provides-the-foundation-in-the-age-of-ai-says-experts/article70627525.ece>The Hindu Tech Summit</a>, experts argued that university education still provides the essential foundation for AI-era careers, but only if it evolves beyond traditional content delivery.</p><p>These are encouraging signals. But embedding &ldquo;AI skills&rdquo; into curricula is only half the equation. Teaching students to use AI tools is necessary. Teaching them what to do when AI handles the tools for them is essential.</p><h2 id=the-4i-question>The 4I Question</h2><p>Here is where the conversation keeps getting stuck. When Suleyman says white-collar tasks will be automated, he is talking about the grind: the repetitive, process-driven, information-shuffling work that fills most knowledge workers&rsquo; days. He is not saying human value disappears. He is saying the vehicle for that value changes.</p><p>This is the core argument of <em>After the Grind</em>. When AI removes the grind, human value doesn&rsquo;t vanish. It concentrates around four capabilities that machines cannot replicate:</p><p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> AI can surface data and identify patterns. It cannot tell you what those patterns mean for your specific organization, culture, or moment in time. The analyst who just runs reports is replaceable. The one who looks at the same numbers and says, &ldquo;Here is what this actually means for us,&rdquo; is not.</p><p><strong>Integration.</strong> AI operates in silos. It processes inputs within the boundaries you set. Humans are the ones who connect marketing strategy to supply chain realities to organizational culture to customer psychology. That cross-domain synthesis, the ability to hold multiple complex systems in mind and find the through-line, remains distinctly human.</p><p><strong>Interpersonal connection.</strong> The workers in that Guardian piece who are pivoting to hands-on, people-facing careers are following an instinct that the research supports. Trust, empathy, negotiation, the ability to read a room and respond to what is unspoken: these are not bugs in a system waiting to be optimized. They are features of human work that become more valuable, not less, as AI handles everything else.</p><p><strong>Imagination.</strong> Not creativity in the &ldquo;write me a poem&rdquo; sense. AI does that fine. I mean the ability to envision futures that do not yet exist, to ask questions nobody has thought to ask, to see possibilities in the gaps between what is and what could be. Strategy, entrepreneurship, and leadership all live here.</p><h2 id=what-this-week-really-tells-us>What This Week Really Tells Us</h2><p>Suleyman&rsquo;s 18-month timeline might be too aggressive. Or it might not. The specific date matters less than the trajectory, which is clear and accelerating. Jobless economic growth is not a temporary blip. Workers leaving white-collar careers for human-centered work is not a fad. Universities restructuring around AI literacy is not optional.</p><p>The question for every business student, every early-career professional, and every educator is no longer &ldquo;Will AI affect my work?&rdquo; It is: &ldquo;When the grind is gone, what do I bring that a machine cannot?&rdquo;</p><p>If your answer is &ldquo;I process information efficiently,&rdquo; you have a problem. If your answer involves interpretation, integration, interpersonal skill, or imagination, you have a future.</p><p>The grind is ending. What comes after it is up to us.</p><hr><p><em>Andrew Perkins is the author of <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GHT7DN7F>After the Grind: Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</a> and Chair of the Department of Marketing and International Business at Washington State University&rsquo;s Carson College of Business.</em></p></section><div class="mt-16 rounded-xl bg-black/[3%] p-8 dark:bg-white/[8%]"><h3 class="mt-0! mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Get essays like this in your inbox</h3><p class="mb-4 text-sm opacity-70">New essays on AI, education, and the future of work.
