Ten years ago, she would have Googled &ldquo;best nursing programs Midwest,&rdquo; scrolled through U.S. News rankings, maybe clicked a few glossy university websites. Five years ago, she might have watched TikToks from current students or browsed Reddit threads. Today? She opens ChatGPT and types: &ldquo;Where should I study nursing if I want to work in pediatric care?&rdquo;</p><p>The answer she gets back won&rsquo;t include your institution&rsquo;s carefully SEO-optimized landing page. It won&rsquo;t reference the $200,000 you spent on that viewbook redesign. It will be a confident, conversational paragraph synthesized from training data, and if your school isn&rsquo;t in that paragraph, you functionally don&rsquo;t exist in her decision-making process.</p><p>Welcome to the invisible admissions office.</p><h2 id=the-new-front-door>The New Front Door</h2><p><a href=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/artificial-intelligence/2026/02/13/reach-students-college-marketers-prioritize>Inside Higher Ed reported this week</a> that college marketers are scrambling to understand what the industry is now calling &ldquo;AI visibility.&rdquo; The concept is straightforward: when prospective students ask AI tools about colleges, programs, or career paths, does your institution show up? And if so, what does the AI say about you?</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t SEO. Search engine optimization operates on keywords, backlinks, metadata. You can game it. You can hire consultants. You can measure it with dashboards. AI visibility is a fundamentally different beast. Large language models synthesize information from massive datasets, and the factors that determine which schools get mentioned are opaque, shifting, and largely outside any marketer&rsquo;s control.</p><p>The data backs up the urgency. Gen Z and Gen Alpha students are increasingly bypassing traditional search engines entirely, going straight to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity for foundational questions about their futures. This isn&rsquo;t a fringe behavior. It&rsquo;s becoming the default.</p><h2 id=why-this-matters-more-than-you-think>Why This Matters More Than You Think</h2><p>The implications go well beyond marketing departments. This shift strikes at the heart of how higher education communicates its value to the world.</p><p>For decades, universities controlled their own narratives. You built a brand. You told your story through admissions counselors, campus visits, alumni networks, and carefully staged promotional materials. The prospective student&rsquo;s journey was a funnel you designed and managed.</p><p>AI chatbots blow up that funnel. When a student asks an AI &ldquo;Is a business degree worth it in 2026?&rdquo;, the answer draws from thousands of sources, weighted in ways nobody fully understands. The AI might cite Bureau of Labor Statistics data, Reddit threads, think-tank reports, and random blog posts with equal authority. Your $50 million business school building and your 98% placement rate might not even register.</p><p>This creates a paradox that should keep every provost up at night: the institutions doing the most interesting, innovative work in education may be the least visible in AI-generated recommendations, simply because they haven&rsquo;t figured out how to make their work legible to language models. Meanwhile, schools with aggressive content strategies and large digital footprints might get mentioned constantly, regardless of actual educational quality.</p><h2 id=the-deeper-problem>The Deeper Problem</h2><p>But here&rsquo;s what really concerns me. The rise of the invisible admissions office is just one symptom of a much larger transformation: AI companies are increasingly setting the terms of engagement for higher education, and universities are mostly playing defense.</p><p><a href=https://dnyuz.com/2026/02/13/a-i-companies-are-eating-higher-education/>A New York Times opinion piece this week</a> put it bluntly: &ldquo;A.I. companies are eating higher education.&rdquo; The author, a university leader, describes how Anthropic charges exorbitant fees for enterprise accounts while simultaneously paying student &ldquo;campus ambassadors&rdquo; to promote its tools. Other companies offer cash bonuses when students hit marketing targets. Venture capital firms celebrate students who build AI tools designed to cheat through job interviews.</p><p>This is not a partnership. It&rsquo;s a colonization.</p><p>Universities are being asked to simultaneously adopt AI tools, teach students to use them responsibly, protect student data from the companies providing those tools, and compete for students whose decision-making is increasingly mediated by those same companies&rsquo; products. The conflicts of interest are staggering, and the power asymmetry is growing.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t think the answer is resistance. AI tools aren&rsquo;t going away, and students are going to use them regardless of what any dean or department chair prefers. But I do think universities need to get much more serious about three things.</p><p>First, <strong>own your narrative in AI-readable formats</strong>. This means structured data, clear program descriptions, and public-facing content that language models can actually parse and surface. Treat AI visibility as infrastructure, not marketing.</p><p>Second, <strong>negotiate from strength, not desperation</strong>. Stop treating AI company partnerships as prestige plays. Demand transparency about how student data is used. Set clear boundaries. If a company wants access to your campus, make them earn it.</p><p>Third, <strong>teach students to interrogate the tools they&rsquo;re using to make life decisions</strong>. If a high school student asks ChatGPT where to go to college and takes the answer at face value, that&rsquo;s a critical thinking failure. And critical thinking is supposed to be what we&rsquo;re selling.</p><p>The invisible admissions office is already open for business. The question is whether universities will learn to operate in this new reality, or whether they&rsquo;ll keep pouring money into brochures that nobody under 25 is reading.</p><hr><p><em>Dr. Andrew Perkins is the author of <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GHT7DN7F>After the Grind: Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</a> and Chair of the Department of Marketing and International Business at Washington State University&rsquo;s Carson College of Business.</em></p></section><div class="mt-16 rounded-xl bg-black/[3%] p-8 dark:bg-white/[8%]"><h3 class="mt-0! mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Get essays like this in your inbox</h3><p class="mb-4 text-sm opacity-70">New essays on AI, education, and the future of work.
