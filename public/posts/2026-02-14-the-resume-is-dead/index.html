It proved you could survive the grind. Four years of coursework, a series of internships, a progression of titles. Each line was a signal: this person showed up, did the work, checked the boxes, and someone in authority stamped their approval.</p><p>That system worked for decades. Not because resumes measured talent. Because the grind was the only reliable proxy we had for competence.</p><p>AI just broke that proxy.</p><h2 id=the-credential-problem>The Credential Problem</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the uncomfortable math. A reasonably intelligent person with access to current AI tools can now produce work product, analysis, writing, code, financial models, marketing strategies, that would have taken a credentialed professional years to develop the skill to create. The output looks the same. Sometimes better.</p><p>So what exactly is the credential signaling?</p><p>If a fresh graduate can use AI to produce a pitch deck that rivals what a five-year associate would have built manually, the pitch deck itself tells you nothing about the person who made it. It tells you they have access to the same tools everyone else has. The signal has collapsed.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t hypothetical. I see it in my classroom every semester. Students producing work that would have been impressive from someone with a decade of experience. The tools make it possible. But here&rsquo;s the part nobody wants to say out loud: producing impressive output is no longer impressive. It&rsquo;s table stakes.</p><h2 id=what-the-resume-cant-show>What the Resume Can&rsquo;t Show</h2><p>The resume was always a poor instrument. It measured things that were easy to measure: degrees, titles, years. It never captured what actually makes someone valuable in a room. Can this person interpret ambiguous information and make a call when the data is incomplete? Can they build trust with someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to trust them? Can they hold three competing priorities in their head and find the path through? Can they imagine a future that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet and convince others it&rsquo;s worth building?</p><p>None of that fits on a single page. None of it comes with a certificate.</p><p>In my book, I argue that human value in the post-AI economy lives in four domains: Interpretive, Integrative, Interpersonal, and Imaginative. These are capacities, not credentials. You can&rsquo;t get a degree in judgment. You can&rsquo;t certify taste. You can&rsquo;t credential the ability to sit with ambiguity and not panic.</p><p>And yet those are exactly the things that matter now.</p><h2 id=the-taste-problem>The Taste Problem</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about taste. I use this word deliberately because it makes business people uncomfortable. Taste sounds subjective. Unserious. Something for designers and chefs, not for strategists and analysts.</p><p>But taste is just another word for trained judgment about quality. It&rsquo;s knowing that the AI-generated marketing copy is technically fine but emotionally dead. It&rsquo;s recognizing that the financial model is internally consistent but built on assumptions that don&rsquo;t survive contact with reality. It&rsquo;s understanding that the strategy deck answers the question that was asked, not the question that should have been asked.</p><p>Taste is the gap between what&rsquo;s correct and what&rsquo;s right. AI can do correct all day long. Right requires a human.</p><h2 id=demonstrated-over-declared>Demonstrated Over Declared</h2><p>So if the resume is dead, what replaces it? I think the answer is demonstrated judgment. Not declared credentials. Not listed skills. Demonstrated capacity to do the work that machines can&rsquo;t.</p><p>This means portfolios over diplomas. It means case studies over bullet points. It means showing your thinking, not just your output. When everyone has the same AI tools, the differentiator isn&rsquo;t what you produce. It&rsquo;s how you think about what you produce.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve started telling my students: don&rsquo;t show me the deliverable. Show me the decisions you made along the way. Show me where you disagreed with the AI&rsquo;s suggestion and why. Show me the moment you realized the brief was wrong and what you did about it. Show me judgment.</p><p>This terrifies people who built their careers on following instructions well. If your primary skill is executing tasks that someone else defined, competently and on time, you have a problem. Not because that skill doesn&rsquo;t matter. But because it&rsquo;s been commoditized. AI does competent execution faster, cheaper, and without complaining about work-life balance.</p><h2 id=working-with-ambiguity>Working With Ambiguity</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a quality I keep coming back to, one that never shows up on resumes but separates the people who thrive from the people who freeze. It&rsquo;s comfort with ambiguity.</p><p>Real business problems are messy. The data conflicts. The stakeholders want different things. The timeline is wrong. The assumptions are questionable. The &ldquo;right answer&rdquo; depends on which question you&rsquo;re actually trying to answer, which itself is debatable.</p><p>AI is brilliant at well-defined problems. Give it clean inputs and clear objectives, and it will optimize beautifully. But the most important work in any organization happens before the problem is well-defined. It happens in the murky, ambiguous space where someone has to figure out what we&rsquo;re even trying to do.</p><p>That person, the one who can operate in ambiguity without demanding premature certainty, is worth more than any credential can express.</p><h2 id=the-hiring-reckoning>The Hiring Reckoning</h2><p>Companies are going to have to reckon with this. The entire hiring apparatus, job descriptions, screening algorithms, interview protocols, is built on the credential-signaling system that AI just gutted.</p><p>When you post a job requiring &ldquo;5+ years of experience in data analysis,&rdquo; what are you actually asking for? If it&rsquo;s the ability to run analyses, AI handles that. If it&rsquo;s the judgment to know which analyses matter, that&rsquo;s not a function of time served. Some people develop that judgment in two years. Some never develop it.</p><p>The organizations that figure this out first will have a massive advantage. They&rsquo;ll hire for capacity, not credentials. They&rsquo;ll test for judgment, not tenure. They&rsquo;ll look for people who can interpret, integrate, connect, and imagine, not people who can list the right software on a resume.</p><h2 id=the-identity-shift>The Identity Shift</h2><p>I know this is hard. For a lot of people, their resume IS their professional identity. Every line represents sacrifice, effort, years of their life. I&rsquo;m not dismissing that. The grind was real. The effort was real. The learning that happened along the way was real.</p><p>But the document that captured all of it? That single page of bullet points and dates? It was always a compression algorithm for something richer and more complex. And now the algorithm is broken.</p><p>The good news is that what it was trying to compress, your actual judgment, your taste, your capacity for human connection, your ability to imagine and build, all of that is more valuable than ever. You just need a better way to show it.</p><p>The resume is dead. Your value isn&rsquo;t. But you&rsquo;re going to have to prove it in ways that no piece of paper can capture.</p><p>Start demonstrating. Stop declaring.</p></section><div class="mt-16 rounded-xl bg-black/[3%] p-8 dark:bg-white/[8%]"><h3 class="mt-0! mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Get essays like this in your inbox</h3><p class="mb-4 text-sm opacity-70">New essays on AI, education, and the future of work.
