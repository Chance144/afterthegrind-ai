<span>Andrew Perkins</span></div></header><section><p>This week&rsquo;s headlines read like a countdown clock that nobody asked for.</p><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s AI chief <a href=https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/microsoft-ai-boss-issues-18-1684833>told reporters</a> that most white-collar tasks could be &ldquo;fully automated&rdquo; within 12 to 18 months. Across the industry, <a href=https://punchng.com/tech-layoffs-hit-30700-amid-ai-shift/>over 30,700 tech jobs have already been eliminated</a> in early 2026 as companies restructure around AI and automation. The Guardian profiled <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/11/big-ai-job-swap-white-collar-workers-ditching-their-careers>white-collar workers abandoning their careers entirely</a>, including a university IT helpdesk employee whose department was replaced by an AI kiosk just months after she was hired. Meanwhile, former Google ethicist Tristan Harris <a href=https://fortune.com/2026/02/10/ai-taking-jobs-report-tristan-harris-google-ethicist-agi-technology/>warned Fortune</a> that unchecked AI could trigger a global jobs market collapse by 2027, going so far as to say: &ldquo;This is the last moment that human political power will matter.&rdquo;</p><p>And in New Delhi, the <a href=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/ai-impact-summit-2026-job-displacement-data-battles-and-the-upskilling-race-heres-what-tech-leaders-say/articleshow/128418373.cms>India AI Impact Summit 2026</a> drew world leaders to debate the scale of this shift. One tech leader put it bluntly: 50% of jobs will be automated. But 50% more jobs will also be created. The question is what those new jobs look like, and who is being prepared to fill them.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s sit with all of that for a moment.</p><h2 id=the-countdown-everyone-feels>The Countdown Everyone Feels</h2><p>There is a particular kind of anxiety that comes from being told your work can be automated, but not being told what you should do instead. That is the gap most people are living in right now.</p><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s 18-month timeline is aggressive, and timelines from tech executives should always carry an asterisk. But even if the actual number is three years, or five, the direction is not in question. The grind, the repetitive, procedural, rules-based work that has defined most white-collar careers for decades, is being absorbed by machines at an accelerating pace.</p><p>The 30,700 jobs eliminated so far this year are not an anomaly. They are the early signal of a structural realignment. Companies are not cutting headcount because times are tough. They are cutting headcount because AI actually works now, and the economics of keeping humans in loop-closing, data-processing, report-generating roles no longer pencil out.</p><h2 id=the-wrong-question-asked-loudly>The Wrong Question, Asked Loudly</h2><p>Most of the public conversation is stuck on the wrong question: &ldquo;Will AI take my job?&rdquo; The answer, increasingly, is yes. Or at least, it will take the parts of your job that feel like a job.</p><p>The better question is: &ldquo;What can I do that AI cannot?&rdquo;</p><p>This is where the panic breaks down into something more useful. Because the answer is not &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; The answer is quite a lot, actually. But it requires us to stop defining professional value as the ability to execute tasks and start defining it as the ability to do things machines are structurally bad at.</p><p>In my book <em>After the Grind</em>, I call this the 4I Framework: four categories of distinctly human value that become more important, not less, as automation advances.</p><p><strong>Interpretive value.</strong> AI can process data. It cannot decide what the data means in context, for this organization, with these stakeholders, at this moment. Interpretation requires judgment born from experience, culture, and situational awareness. When Harris warns that human political power may soon be irrelevant, he is essentially warning that we are failing to exercise our interpretive capacity at the moment it matters most.</p><p><strong>Integrative value.</strong> The workers who will thrive are not specialists who know one domain deeply. They are connectors who can synthesize across domains. The India AI Summit&rsquo;s emphasis on skilling and education points to this. But most upskilling programs teach people how to use AI tools. Very few teach people how to integrate AI outputs with human judgment, organizational knowledge, and cross-functional strategy. That integration is the real skill.</p><p><strong>Interpersonal value.</strong> The Guardian&rsquo;s story about the university IT worker replaced by an AI kiosk is telling. Not because the kiosk is better at solving tickets (it probably is). But because a helpdesk is not just a problem-solving interface. It is a human touchpoint. Students who are frustrated, confused, or overwhelmed do not need a chatbot. They need someone who can read the room. The organizations that strip out every human touchpoint in the name of efficiency will discover, eventually, that trust and loyalty are interpersonal products. You cannot automate your way to a relationship.</p><p><strong>Imaginative value.</strong> AI is excellent at optimization. It is poor at origination. It can remix existing patterns endlessly, but it does not wake up one morning with a vision that no one has articulated before. The new jobs that emerge from this transition will disproportionately reward people who can imagine new products, new services, new business models, new ways of organizing human effort. Imagination is not a soft skill. It is the hardest skill there is, and it is about to become the most valuable one.</p><h2 id=the-education-problem>The Education Problem</h2><p>The India AI Summit&rsquo;s focus on education and employability is encouraging, but the conversation is still too narrow. Most of the proposals center on teaching students how to code, how to prompt, how to work alongside AI systems. Those are fine starting points, but they are not sufficient.</p><p>If 50% of current jobs disappear and 50% new ones appear, the transition does not happen automatically. It happens through education systems that teach people to interpret ambiguity, integrate across boundaries, connect with other humans, and imagine what does not yet exist. Right now, most business schools (I run a department in one, so I say this with full self-awareness) are scrambling to add AI courses to their catalogs. The harder, more important work is redesigning the entire curriculum around the question: what is a human professional for, when the grind is gone?</p><h2 id=the-last-moment>The Last Moment</h2><p>Harris&rsquo;s phrase sticks with me: &ldquo;the last moment that human political power will matter.&rdquo; It is a dramatic claim. But the underlying logic is sound. If human labor becomes economically marginal, then the political leverage that comes from being a worker, a taxpayer, a participant in the economy, erodes with it.</p><p>The counter to that erosion is not to slow down AI. That ship has sailed, and it was never really in port to begin with. The counter is to build the human capabilities that make us indispensable in ways that go beyond task execution. To invest in the interpretive, integrative, interpersonal, and imaginative capacities that define what it means to be a professional after the grind.</p><p>We are not in the last moment that matters. But we may be in the last moment where it is easy to act. The difference is significant.</p><hr><p><em>Andrew Perkins is the author of <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GHT7DN7F>After the Grind: Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</a> and Chair of the Department of Marketing and International Business at Washington State University&rsquo;s Carson College of Business.</em></p></section><div class="mt-16 rounded-xl bg-black/[3%] p-8 dark:bg-white/[8%]"><h3 class="mt-0! mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Get essays like this in your inbox</h3><p class="mb-4 text-sm opacity-70">New essays on AI, education, and the future of work.
