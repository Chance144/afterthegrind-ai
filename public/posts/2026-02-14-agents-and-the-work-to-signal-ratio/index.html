<span>Andrew Perkins</span></div></header><section><h1 id=agents-and-the-work-to-signal-ratio>Agents and the Work-to-Signal Ratio</h1><p>Think about the last time you researched something for work. Not the moment you understood it. The hours before that moment. The Googling. The opening of fourteen tabs. The copying of relevant paragraphs into a document. The reformatting. The rewriting so it sounded like you and not like a Wikipedia article. The making of a chart because someone on the team &ldquo;needs to see the visual.&rdquo; The uploading, the linking, the publishing.</p><p>Now think about the part that actually mattered: the insight you pulled from all of it. The recommendation you made. The judgment call that moved the project forward.</p><p>That ratio, the meaningful human contribution divided by the total effort, is what I call the work-to-signal ratio. And for most of modern professional life, it has been terrible.</p><h2 id=the-long-history-of-almost-getting-there>The Long History of Almost Getting There</h2><p>Every generation of workplace technology has promised to fix this. Spreadsheets automated arithmetic. Email sped up communication. Google made information retrieval instant. Dashboards gave us real-time data. Each one was genuinely transformative. And each one still left humans doing enormous amounts of low-signal work.</p><p>Google gave you the answer, but you still had to find it among ten blue links, verify it, copy it, contextualize it, and format it for your audience. Spreadsheets did the math, but you still built the model, debugged the formulas, and spent an hour making the formatting presentable. Even ChatGPT, as revolutionary as it felt in 2023, was essentially a very good conversation partner. You asked a question, got a response, then still had to do something with it: paste it somewhere, edit it, check it, integrate it into whatever you were actually building.</p><p>The human remained stuck in the middle. Not doing the thinking, but doing everything around the thinking: reformatting the output from one tool so it could go into another, copying data between systems, cleaning up what the search returned, organizing what the spreadsheet produced. That busywork was THE GRIND. The tedious, repetitive scaffolding that sat between having an idea and acting on it.</p><h2 id=agents-collapse-the-scaffolding>Agents Collapse the Scaffolding</h2><p>This is what makes agentic AI fundamentally different from everything that came before it. Not incrementally different. Structurally different.</p><p>With an agent, you do not search, synthesize, format, and publish. You state your intent. The agent does the execution. What comes back is the signal: the draft, the analysis, the summary, the action taken. Your contribution is the idea, the direction, the editorial judgment, the decision about what to do with the output. That is the signal.</p><p>The scaffolding disappears.</p><p>This is not theoretical. It is happening now, across every domain. <a href=https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/>GitHub launched Agentic Workflows this week</a>, letting developers describe repository tasks in plain Markdown and hand execution to AI agents running inside GitHub Actions. No more writing complex YAML. No more manually triaging issues. State the intent, review the output. <a href=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/>Apple&rsquo;s Xcode 26.3 now embeds coding agents</a> from Anthropic and OpenAI directly into the development environment, letting developers hand off complex implementation tasks while they focus on architecture and design. <a href=https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2026/02/11/google-makes-etsy-and-wayfair-items-shoppable-within-agentic-ai-search>Google is rolling out agentic commerce tools</a> that let AI agents complete purchases across platforms like Etsy and Wayfair on your behalf. Even <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/meridian-ai-raises-17-million-to-remake-the-agentic-spreadsheet/>financial modeling is going agentic</a>, with startups like Meridian raising millions to build agent-driven alternatives to the spreadsheets that have defined corporate finance for decades.</p><p>The pattern is consistent. The execution layer is being absorbed. What remains is the human layer: the intent, the judgment, the direction.</p><h2 id=this-is-not-about-being-lazy>This Is Not About Being Lazy</h2><p>I want to be clear about something, because this is where the conversation usually goes sideways. When people hear &ldquo;agents do the work for you,&rdquo; the instinct is to assume this is about doing less. About cutting corners. About professionals becoming passive consumers of AI output.</p><p>It is the opposite.</p><p>When the scaffolding disappears, what is left is the hardest, most demanding work humans do. Interpretation: looking at an agent&rsquo;s output and asking whether it is actually right, whether it captures what matters, whether something critical is missing. Integration: understanding how one piece of work connects to the broader system, the team&rsquo;s priorities, the organization&rsquo;s strategy. Interpersonal work: communicating the output in a way that builds trust, earns buy-in, moves people. Imagination: seeing what the output makes possible that was not possible before.</p><p>These are the four domains of the 4I model I describe in <em>After the Grind</em>. Interpretive. Integrative. Interpersonal. Imaginative. They are not new capabilities. They have always been the deepest layers of human professional contribution. The problem was that THE GRIND buried them. When you spend six hours building a presentation deck, you have maybe forty-five minutes left to think about what the presentation actually means and how to deliver it in a way that changes someone&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>Agents give that time back. Not as leisure. As capacity.</p><h2 id=the-real-example>The Real Example</h2><p>Here is a concrete illustration. This essay you are reading right now. In a pre-agent world, writing and publishing a daily essay on a niche topic would require hours of work: researching recent news, reading multiple articles, synthesizing a thesis, drafting, editing, formatting for the web, adding links, publishing. A person doing all of that daily would burn out in a week or settle for shallow content.</p><p>With an agent, the process looks different. I have an idea. I articulate the argument I want to make and the style I want to write in. The agent researches current stories, drafts the essay, formats it, adds links to this week&rsquo;s news. What comes back is a draft. My job is the signal work: Does this argument hold? Does it sound like me? Is the framing right? What needs to change?</p><p>My contribution is the thesis and the editorial judgment. That is the work that matters. That is the signal. And the ratio of signal to total effort just went from maybe 15% to something closer to 80%.</p><p>This is THE GRIND disappearing in real time.</p><h2 id=what-this-means-for-professionals>What This Means for Professionals</h2><p>The implication for careers is significant and, I think, hopeful. For decades, professional value was measured largely by execution capacity. How fast can you build the model? How many reports can you produce? How efficiently can you manage the data pipeline? That measurement always undervalued the deeper human work: the interpretation, the connection-building, the imagination.</p><p>Agents do not replace professionals. They redefine where professional value lives. The work-to-signal ratio improves not because humans contribute less, but because humans finally get to contribute at the level they should have been operating at all along.</p><p>The Sensemaker who questions whether the agent&rsquo;s confident analysis is actually correct. The Architect who designs the workflow so that agents and humans complement each other. The Liaison who takes the agent&rsquo;s output and translates it into language that earns trust across the organization. The Narrative Carrier who shapes the story beneath the data.</p><p>These are not futuristic roles. They are this week&rsquo;s roles. The scaffolding is collapsing. The signal is what remains.</p><p>The question is not whether agents will do the work. They already are. The question is whether you are ready to do the part that only you can do.</p><hr><p><em>Andrew Perkins is the author of <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GHT7DN7F>After the Grind: Rethinking Your Business Career in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</a> and Chair of the Department of Marketing and International Business at Washington State University&rsquo;s Carson College of Business.</em></p></section><div class="mt-16 rounded-xl bg-black/[3%] p-8 dark:bg-white/[8%]"><h3 class="mt-0! mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Get essays like this in your inbox</h3><p class="mb-4 text-sm opacity-70">New essays on AI, education, and the future of work.
